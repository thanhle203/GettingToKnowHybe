## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

**Trying to find the perfect header photo that would go well with the website. The project overall wasn't too challenging but styling all of the components did take some time. Making sure that the awning that I put at the top was perfect would be the most difficult challenge in this project. I was able to complete the project in one sitting.**
